## <div align="center">Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sammy</div>

I'm Sam, a student/developer living in Singapore. I'm an avid lover of programming, OSS and all things computery.

I mostly write CLI apps, but I've also fallen in love with systems programming (as evidenced by the projects I do).

### Current Projects:
- rcwm (Rust) - a small X server window manager using XCB bindings
- Wisteria (C) - an operating system for the Raspberry Pi 4
- Lemur (Go) - A [Monkey](https://interpreterbook.com) implementation with a planned native code JIT compiler
- raccoonOS (C) - A small UNIX-like personal operating system
- Verdigris (Rust) - a register-based language VM with its own assembly code

### Personal Stuff:
- OS: Void Linux
- IDE: VSCode
- Pronouns: They/Them
