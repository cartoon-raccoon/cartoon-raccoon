## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam, a student/developer living in Singapore. I'm an avid lover of programming, OSS and all things computery.

I have a couple of projects on this site, but the one I'm most proud of is Cogsy, a Discogs client that I built in Rust.
I specialize in backend development and I mostly write CLI apps and web backends. I've also fallen in love with systems programming (as evidenced by my languages of choice).

### Current Projects:
- Oyster - a Bash-like Unix shell written in Rust
- rlox - A Rust implementation of a [Lox](http://craftinginterpreters.com) VM

### Planned projects
- Torque - a CLI bittorrent client written in Go
- Verdigris - an interpreted programming language implemented in Rust
- A Rust CLI Spotify client (similar to spotify-tui)
- A fullstack bugtracker service with C++ GUI and Rust TUI clients, and a Go backend
- Migrating from KDE to BSPWM/OpenboxWM (for that r/unixporn street cred, yaknow?)

### Languages I know:
- Rust
- Go
- Python

### Languages I'm learning:
- C and C++
- Javascript (Node and React)
- Haskell
- Clojure

### Personal Stuff:
- OS: Arch Linux (btw) with KDE
- IDE: VSCodium
- Pronouns: They/Them
