## <div align="center">Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sammy</div>

I'm Sam, a student/developer living in Singapore. I'm an avid lover of programming, OSS and all things computery.

I mostly write CLI apps, but I've also fallen in love with systems programming (as evidenced by the projects I do).

### Current Projects:
- Oyster (Rust) - a fully fledged Unix shell with most common shell features and a custom scripting language
- Verdigris (Rust) - A Rust-inspired interpreted programming language that compiles to custom bytecode with its own VM
- Monkey-JIT (Go) - A [Monkey](https://interpreterbook.com) implementation with a planned LLVM native code JIT compiler
- raccoonOS (C) - A small UNIX-like personal operating system

### Personal Stuff:
- OS: Arch Linux (btw) with KDE
- IDE: VSCodium
- Pronouns: They/Them
