## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam, a student/developer living in Singapore. I'm an avid lover of programming, OSS and all things computery.

I mostly write CLI apps, but I've also fallen in love with systems programming (as evidenced by my languages of choice).

### Current Projects:
- Oyster - a Bash-like Unix shell written in Rust
- Verdigris - A Rust-inspired interpreted programming language with its own VM
- rlox - A Rust implementation of a [Lox](http://craftinginterpreters.com) VM
- raccoonOS - A UNIX-like operating system

### Personal Stuff:
- OS: Arch Linux (btw) with KDE
- IDE: VSCodium
- Pronouns: They/Them
